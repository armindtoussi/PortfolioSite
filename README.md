# PortfolioSite
Personal portfolio/resume site

This repository is to house my Portfolio site while i'm at school. I will store all the code here while maintaining the file structure of my website however, i do not think i will store images and files on here as that serves no purpose in this case as it is simply a showcase. 

There is nothing fancy about how I built the site. It is simply built with bootstrap's framework. My focus is not on website building and to that end i just wanted a place to showcase myself and host some blogging. So i kept it simple. I will try to add some more backend and front end functionality at later dates, but for now term two has started and i will focus on school.

EDIT Jan 7th, 2016

I would like to point out that I am not including the bootstrap framework here, although i use the bootstrap frame work for this site, i do not see the point in posting the files to a framework that is opensource and readily available. The same goes for jquery. The same goes for images as previously mentioned, i think that goes without saying however.
