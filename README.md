# PortfolioSite
Personal portfolio/resume site

This repository is to house my Portfolio site while i'm at school. I will store all the code here while maintaining the file structure of my website however, i do not think i will store images and files on here as that serves no purpose in this case as it is simply a showcase. 

There is nothing fancy about how I built the site. It is simply built with bootstrap's framework. My focus is not on website building and to that end i just wanted a place to showcase myself and host some blogging. So i kept it simple. I will try to add some more backend and front end functionality at later dates, but for now term two has started and i will focus on school.
