                        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 27, 2015 by Armin</p>
                        <p>Well since i'm late as far as blogging as it happens, i'm gonna just give a short summary of the term one courses
                            for my CST blog here, just to give people an idea of what it was like and starting in term two I will do my best 
                            to blog as I go so-to-speak. Well term one you get a math course that introduces you to a lot of key topics such as 
                            binary conversion, number systems, storing numbers, matrices and much more. Probably the toughest part was boolean 
                            algebra.</p>
                        <h3>Teacher</h3>
                        <p>As of fall 2014, the course teach is Paul Rozman, I think that's how you spell it. Paul's a great teacher.  He does a 
                            good job of explaining what you are doing, works through examples with the group in lectures, and will always spend
                            time with you if you need it in lab. He has a great personality and knows how to talk to a group. His lectures are 
                            the least dull out of all the teachers.  You never fell asleep in his class.  That being said, for Paul, everything is 
                            easy, I believe he has a masters in math. Some people have a problem with this attitude, I dont personally as I agree 
                            with him.  Not to say if you don't get it you are  stupid, far from it, what I mean is that with the proper instruction 
                            and practice, it is easy. I mean that can  be said about almost anything. The thing is Paul is good at putting things 
                            in a way that MAKE things easy.  Regardless, Paul is a great teacher, and has a great rating on "ratemyprof" to show it.</p>
                        <h3>The Material</h3>
                        <p>The material is mostly quite simple and straight forward.  We started with binary conversions and conversions between 
                            other base numbers like octal, hexadecimal, and so on.  This is a very simple thing to learn and do, and serves as a 
                            nice start of new students.  We then moved on to number systems like 1c, 2c, excess, bias and so on. This stuff 
                            can be a little unnatural, but it's not super hard either.  We did adding and such in binary and then we moved on to 
                            storing floating point numbers using the IEEE standard. This was also super simple and if you got the binary and stuff
                            then this is natural and easy too.  The first tough part came with boolean algebra. The concept is simple, boolean logic, 
                            it just involves figuring out all possible permutations and figuring out possible outcomes based on certain inputs and such. 
                            The idea isn't so hard, you use 'and' 'or' 'nor' and other such operators to figure this out. The hard part comes in the 
                            form of simplifying using postulates. This is VERY counter-intuitive as it does not use standard mathematical operations. 
                            The rules are not the same as regular algebra and you have to learn an entirely new way of doing things.</p>
                        <p id="java"> From there we built logic circuits which was pretty cool and also very easy. The last topic we target was matrices. 
                            The idea behind it is straight forward but super tedious. To becoome good at this takes time and practice 
                            but the nice thing is, Paul introduces you to the rotational matrix equation which is what you use to rotate objects
                            in 2D or 3D space. It was very interesting.  It is by no means a traditional math course but I found it a lot of 
                            fun and hopefully you will too.</p>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">COMP1510 Java</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 27, 2015 by Armin</p>
                        <p>Alright so this is what you would call the 'flagship' course of the first term. It is the most code heavy course and it 
                            introduces you to programming, more specifically object-oriented programming(OOP).  Java is quite a simple language to use
                            and there are a lot of rules in place in Java that stop you from doing things that may get you confused or into trouble
                            with other languages such as C++.  The real difficulty of this course is understanding the abstract nature of OOP and 
                            programming in general.  I already had a bunch of experience in Java so this course wasn't super hard for me. There was 
                            a bit of thinking involved with the last assignment but other than that it was mostly straight forward.  I will say this, 
                            if you have A LOT of trouble with this course then perhaps programming isn't for you although i have heard of people 
                            that get super confused at first but by the end of the first year they are get it and it clicks with them. Regardless 
                            this decision is up to you.</p>
                        <h3>Teacher</h3>
                        <p>The teacher, Bruce Link, is a basically a genius and has a doctorate in CS.  He's a super smart guy and has a ton 
                            of experience under his belt. That  being said, he seems really bored teaching the intro Java course.  He is a
                            big advocate of Java and seems to love the language. When someone asks a question beyond the course material he 
                            really gets into it and displays his obvious knowledge. I did like Bruce however, his lectures are extremely dull. 
                            I had a couple of friends who had him in lab once a week and they said he just talked on and on at length about 
                            Java and such and didn't really spend his time working with students or marking their work.  I have heard however,
                            that if you go to him during office hours, that he is exceptionally helpful but i never did so i'm not sure personally.
                            If you have no programming experience then you are gonna want to make sure you grab the book and read up ahead of time 
                            so that you are prepared for class, and he is really great with answering questions in lecture so come prepared and you
                            should do just fine.</p>
                        <h3>The Material</h3>
                        <p>I'm not gonna go over all the material here like I did with the math course but what I will say is that we basically 
                            go over all the basic OOP and general programming concepts. The idea of data types, encapsulation, class, objects/instances,
                            object creation, sorting, basic algorithms, loops, if statements, and much more. The material starts off really simple 
                            and easy but begins to become more complex. The difficult part comes after midterms as we being to discuss abstraction and 
                            more difficult concepts such as polymorphism, abstract classes, design, and more. If you can relate programming 
                            concepts to everyday things then you will do alright.</p>
                        <p>All in all, this course is not super hard but it is by far the most important course for you to do well in as it 
                            starts the process of building up your programming knowledge and leads into more difficult concepts. Ask lots of 
                            questions and study the material ahead of time and you will be just fine imho.</p>

                        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 27, 2015 by Armin</p>
                        <p>This is a sort of loose ends course. It teaches you about things that are needed but they could not find a better
                            place to put them.  You will learn about excel/xml, CLI, Power Shell, Bash scripting/automation, version control, 
                            and more. This course is mostly a gimmie other than one group presentation project due at the end of the term.</p>
                        <h3>Teacher</h3>
                        <p>Nikhil Bhwardaj(I think that's the spelling) is the teacher and he has a great personality. His lectures are mostly
                            entertaining and he has a good sense of humor.  What I and other students didn't like was that he was, at times, 
                            very condescending.  He would say, " oh guys have you heard of this program, oh you haven't, well you are in the
                            wrong program then". Which may not seem like much but when he does it over and over again for the course of the 
                            term it becomes annoying it is condescending because it's an introductory computing program with no computing 
                            prereqs.  That aside, as i said his lectures were always entertaining and informative. Problem is there is no 
                            supplemental book or anything for the course. He would leave a bunch of links on his slides, but they weren't 
                            consistent with the information across all the links and throughout his course. He would then give you a quiz 
                            the following lab that was above and beyond what he would teach. Which for a course that holds no real weight 
                            in the grand scheme of things, to me, was a problem. He did teach a lot of interesting things and i did learn a
                            lot of things, and a lot of things that i want to look into in the future. His lab personality was not as good, 
                            I felt like he wasn't really all that approachable. I felt that if you asked him a question he looked down on you 
                            like it was the wrong question to ask or something. Maybe i'm just being a spoiled Westerner, who knows. </p>
                        <p> Well enough people complained about him to program head, as it was his first year teaching the course, that 
                            he had a talking to and had to tone down his quizzes and such but this just led to him not caring about the 
                            course at all anymore. Which i suppose for some was a good thing but at the same time it wasn't. I've said enough
                            about this guy, who really, i did like but for some reason there was some issues there.</p>
                        <h3>The Material</h3>
                        <p>The material is mostly simple but there will be things that you will be confused about or unsure about. The advice 
                            I can give though, is to make sure you study his slides well and if you have time make sure you do check out 
                            the links that he leaves for you to look at because they are informative and he will often quiz on that material
                            and not strictly stick to what he taught or his slides. </p>
                        <p>This course is mostly a gimmie but you will find some frustration in it if it is the same teacher teaching it 
                            in the future.</p>

                        <p>This is a standard communications course taught but Frank Schnurr. This course is exactly what you expect it to be. 
                            It's basically and English course that tries to focus on technical writing for the workplace. You are taught how 
                            to write reports of various kinds, how to present orally, and communicate via letter and email. I kinda feel bad 
                            because everyone hates communication course but the teacher, Frank, is great.</p>
                        <h3>Teacher</h3>
                        <p>Frank is a great teacher. He is a down to earth guy with a good personality, and is a great presenter. He tries a 
                            a lot to appeal to the audience, which lets face it, is 125 computer nerds. He frequently used video games and 
                            <em>Lord of the Rings</em> references to appeal to the group. I personally do not like LotR so this was painful 
                            for me, and sometimes his references came off as cringe worthy. That being said, he did a good job of appealing to 
                            the crowd and getting us on his side. I really liked Frank, and im glad he was our teacher, and i'm looking 
                            forward to having him again for the term two communications course.</p>
                        <h3>The Material</h3>
                        <p>The material is pretty straight forward especially if you have just come off of doing English 12. He starts off
                            with a grammer and punctuation review for a bout two weeks before he actually gets into the real material. This 
                            course is also mostly a gimmie as it involves few, and easy assignments. You have to write some reports and some 
                            inter-office emails. The exams are writing exams where you have to write a type or report or email and he is 
                            very forgiving with the exams. His assignment marking however, is a bit more detailed and you will want to 
                            spend a lot more time proofreading them.</P>
                            <P>The one big assingment you have to do is a presentation. You have to 
                            pick a computing topic, research it, and do a presentation on it.  The topic choices are pretty wide open as he 
                            said a topic in computing/IT, but some people's ideas of that were pretty loose and some people basically talked 
                            about their favourite thing and loosely tied it too computing.  I would say this was one of the more anxiety producing
                            assingments of the whole term acroess all courses. People generally don't like to do presentations but i'm gonna 
                            tell you right now that you have to get used to it as there are going to be lots of presentations if you are 
                            in this program and in the future in the work place. Frank's wife is a software dev and he was saying how 
                            she does presenations all the time. So it's best to not take the 'laissez-faire' attitude about it and actually 
                            try your best, and practice it, a lot. Also if you can go in the first presentation week, he is generally far
                            more lenient on you. People seemed to agree that my presentation was quite good and informative but I recieved 
                            a poorer mark than some people that went in the first week and clearly didn't do as well.</p>
                        <p>Frank is a great dude, and a good teacher, it's just too bad he is teaching a communications course haha. This 
                            will be one of the simpler courses you will take and should allow you to focus more on the important ones 
                            like math and java. Regardless, the labs were fun.</p>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">COMP 1536 </h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 27, 2015 by Armin</p>
                        <p>Alright, this is a course on web development. This was probably my least favourite course. I don't dislike web, 
                            I don't mind it, it's not my fav but still. This course however, was EXTREMELY poorly organized and all over 
                            the map.  The teacher, Medhat Elmsary, is a nice guy with a decent personality, and he tends to do hands on 
                            demo's for lecture.  The course is designed to teach you HTML, CSS, and introduce you to javascript, php, AJAX, 
                            and json. Ya, that's a lot of stuff for a 15 week course.  This is part of the problem with the course, it simply
                            tries to teach FAR too much. The HTML CSS section is well done for the most part but the issue comes in the 
                            second term fo the course.</p>
                        <h3>Teacher</h3>
                        <p>Medhat is a good guy, lenient and relaxed.  You may call into question early, about his abilties. He is a slow 
                            demo'er and makes a LOT of mistakes while he is demoing. Not only that but any coding habits he may have get 
                            thrown out the door while he is demoing. He doesn't indent or follow and coding structure or practices while 
                            he is teaching. Which may not seem like a big thing, and perhaps it isn't, but for me it kinda is. I get that 
                            you are demoing in front of 125 students but you need to follow perfect code practices at all times so that 
                            these new students in programming get accustomed to how it should be. Anyway, he is a funny guy, takes part in 
                            some jokes during lectures. His organization of the course is a bit troubling. Not sure if it is the fault of 
                            the curriculum or it is just him but the second half of the course is poorly organized.</p>
                        <h3>The Material</h3>
                        <p>The material is pretty straight forward especially if you have some experience in HTML.  The first half is all 
                            HTML and CSS, for which the syntax is quite simple so you should have no problems with this even if you are 
                            new to it. The second half is where things get troubling as i have said. You start getting php, javascript, json, and 
                            AJAX thrown at you so fast you have no time to practice and learn the material well. There are no sets of exercises
                            that you can do. You get one lab exercise in a week, and you we got 3 assignments for which there are usually 4.
                            For javascript we had an assignment that required us to create a javascript drawing of a house with animated smoke.
                            The problem he was that we weren't even taught much about animation. We were required to draw the smoke and animate it 
                            however, when he demo'd animation in class he used an image, which is a lot easier. A lot of people had problems 
                            with this assignment. I personally found myself helping multiple people 1hr before the deadline. This was not
                            uncommon. That was the last assignment of the term and it was the only assignment for the second half of the term.
                            From there it was one day of php, next day ajax, next day some html he hadn't taught us yet, next was javascript,
                            it truly was erratic. I personally would just have liked a little more flow. But anyway, that's my thoughts on the 
                            course, and i dont like speaking of it so negatively because i did learn a lot in the course, but it definitely 
                            needs to improve.</P>
                            <P>The one big assingment you have to do is a presentation. You have to 
                            pick a computing topic, research it, and do a presentation on it.  The topic choices are pretty wide open as he

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">BUSA 2720</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 27, 2015 by Armin</p>
                        <p>BUSA is a business economics course. This course is about the economy and business. It talks about management, 
                            marketing, macroeconomics, micro economics, and such. The course goes into a bit of detail but doesn't go too 
                            crazy. Some people did have trouble with this course because the lectures don't emcompass all of the information,
                            you have to study the book quite a bit to do really well in this course. The nice thing is the quizzes and 
                            exams are mostly straight from the textbook test banks. So if you bought the book you can practice all the 
                            questions and you should ace the tests. I will say that a lot of the students who were fresh out of high school
                            had the most trouble with this course, and the people that were a little older and perhaps spent some time in 
                            the work force seemed to do a little better; however, like I said, if you grab the book and study it you should 
                            be ok.</p>
                        <h3>Teacher</h3>
                        <p>Peter Morgan is the teacher for this course and my first impression of him was that of a hard ass. I first saw
                            him lecture and thought he was a bit standoffish and as he was a previous industry professional. Boy was i wrong,
                            when we finally got into lab with Peter, he was great. He runs his labs in a very collaborative way. The labs are 
                            very discussion heavy and the assignments he gives out are generally quite simple to complete only requiring 
                            a little research and some thought. The problem i had with the teacher was his lecture delivery and style. 
                            There is just so much information for him to deliver, especially in the second half of the course, that he 
                            speaks really fast and sometimes forgets to breathe. He is also not as sharp with answering questions during 
                            lecture. I think he makes up for it with great labs though. I thoroughly enjoyed Peter. One more thing I will say 
                            is that even though he initially seems like a corportate badass type of thing, he is actually very forgiving. He'll
                            call out people to contribute to lab discussion that may not normally talk so much and even if they struggle 
                            with the answer, he is very forgiving and tends to help that person along with the answer. I think in a small 
                            group, he is such a great teacher.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Material</h3>
                        <p>The material itself can be tough for some. It takes a lot of reading and memorization. Personally i didn't do a 
                            whole lot for this course except study the questions from the test bank and i did relatively well. I'll say though,
                            i dropped the ball on the final because i was lazy and didn't study for it at all. Thought in general, with not 
                            buying the book, I did pretty well as i still ended the course with an 'A'. The lectures and the labs don't really 
                            live together, they are kind of separate entities. Peter gives small assignments in labs that are pretty straight 
                            forward. He forces you to think about business and economics and put yourself in the shoes of a businessman or 
                            entrepreneur. It can be useful and enlightening.  The one thing i really didn't like about the course was that 
                            one of the two lectures was movie watching time. He has 3 documentaries relating to business and economics such 
                            as the Enron documentary, and the global financial crisis documentary. You then have to do assignments that 
                            relate to these movies. Personally, i stopped going to that lecture after 3-4 visits because I like watching 
                            those types of films on my own time anyway so I just watched them on my own time and did the assignments.</P>
                        <P>Not much more to say about this course other than it is one of those necessary courses in the curriculum
                            that you have to complete but it's really not that bad. </p>
                       <hr />
                        <p>Well for anyone reading this, that's it for the first term review. From here on out i will be doing my best 
                            to ensure that i blog as i go through the next term as it happens. Hopefully you guys can find some useful 
                            information here that will either help you decide to take this program, help you through the program, or 
                            prepare you for what is ahead. Thanks for reading.</p>
