                        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 5, 2015 by Armin</p>
                        <p>Well term two has begun. It started yesterday and although the labs are mostly cancelled this week, 
                            we still have lectures all week with the occassional lab. This is nice but also can create problems 
                            depending on your schedule. Our set/cohort, Set D, almost got stuck with a 5 hour break between morning
                            lab and afternoon lectures. Luckily, our morning instructor moved things to another day so that was 
                            great. I've met all of my lecture instructors now, with only a couple of lab instructors to meet.</p>
                        <h3>Teachers</h3>
                        <P>To summarize, so far so good. Most of the teachers seem really great so far. For Discrete Math we have
                            a man called Goran Ruzic and he seems really cool. Like the name suggests, he seems to be Eastern 
                            European of some kind. He speaks clearly and is very deliberate. Teaching in general seems different
                            this term, less power point style teaching and more hands on example type teachin and Goran follows
                            this trend.</p>
                            
                        <p>For Java level 2 we have a man called Dennis and he is very down to earth. He comes 
                            off as being just like one of us. He seems like a coder and seems very relateable. I'm looking forward
                            to that class as he discussed we will be building bigger programs some of it being over time 
                            and slowly adding modules to the programs. That sounds very interesting.</P>
                    
                        <p>We have a man called Albert H. Wei for our C programming course.  I have been told in the past 
                            by other T.A.'s and teachers that Albert is an absolute genius.  With my first impressions under 
                            my belt, I will say that he is very unique to say the least.  He is an older Asian gentleman and 
                            has a very comical way of talking, but he is able to keep people's attention and make them 
                            laugh too. Apparently he is very straight forward and tells you what's on the exams and what 
                            to do for them.  C programming is a lot harder than Java, or so i've heard, so i'm interested
                            to see how this turns out. Really looking forward to his course.</p>
                    
                        <p>Computer Architecture is another course we have and the teacher is Jason Harrison. I've taken
                            a couple courses with Jason already and I think he is absolutely great.  I've gotten used 
                            to his straight forward tell-it-like-it-is method of teaching. He doesn't waste time, he's 
                            right to the point and no B.S. Students have already seem to have taken to him just like 
                            i took to him in my previous courses.  He told us how to be successful in the course and 
                            more importantly gave us a big warning in that if we fall behind in the course we will 
                            probably not be able to catch up. It'll be interesting to see the differences between 
                            how he teaches this course and other courses.</p>
                    
                        <p>I had my first Database lecture today by Keith Tang.  Man, i hate to be that guy but
                            holy that was boring. It's a two hour lecture, which is rare, but this is gonna be 
                            painful. Part of the reason that's going to be the case is because it is a two hour
                            lecture on one of the more boring topics after a REALY long day.  I do like him however,
                            as he is very good at explaining things and making sure we understand them so far. 
                            Keith is definitely an old school type of guy, but i dont mind that, for me it's more 
                            the lateness of the course and the length of the lecture. It's always hard to keep 
                            students entertained for 2 hours in a lecture but doing it when you are teaching 
                            database has got to be hard. We'll see how this course pans out, but databases are 
                            an integral part of any software dev's tool kit.</p>
                        
                        <p>The last course is a communications course and the teacher is the same as last term
                            and if you have read my december term one summary blogs then you will know that 
                            it is Frank Schnurr. I'm not looking forward to communications however, Frank is great 
                            and im looking forward to interacting with him again.</p>
                        <h3>Finally</h3>
                        <p>Well so far i've enjoyed meeting my teachers and seeing my term one friends again. I'm
                            really going to try and keep this blog going throughout the year, it's one of my goals.
                            However, I don't expect to do it more than once or twice a week as things get going. 
                            Anyways, i look forward to what this term brings and hopefully i pass, as this is 
                            one of the terms of death. Thanks</p>
